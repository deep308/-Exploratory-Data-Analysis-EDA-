# 🚢 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Task 5 - Data Analyst Internship**

This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aimed at discovering patterns, trends, and relationships using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Titanic survival dataset** from the [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv).

- **Records:** 891
- **Features:** PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- **Target Variable:** `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Identify missing values, outliers, and feature relationships
- Generate insights using charts and statistics
- Deliver a report and supporting files

---

## 📊 Key EDA Steps & Visuals

| Plot | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Age Distribution` | Histogram showing that most passengers were in the 20–40 age range. |
| `Fare vs Pclass` | Boxplot indicating that 1st class passengers paid higher fares. |
| `Correlation Heatmap` | Reveals relationships among features. Fare correlates negatively with Pclass, and moderately with Survived. |
| `Pairplot` | Visualizes interactions between Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived. |

---

## 📌 Summary of Findings

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Age and Fare are significant variables affecting survival.
- Many missing values in `Cabin`, and several in `Age`.
